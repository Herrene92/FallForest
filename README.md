# FallForest
**How does recursion allow small changes to ripple through the whole structure?     
 *
Recursion lets one small action spread through the entire tree. When the fallLeaves() method runs on the main branch, it automatically calls itself on every smaller branch and sub-branch. So, one command at the top (“start autumn”) makes the same leaf-falling process happen everywhere in the tree, no matter how many levels there are.

 ** Where else in nature or daily life do you see recursive patterns?
In nature, we see recursion in things like trees (branches that grow smaller branches), ferns (each leaf looks like a smaller version of the whole), and mountains (big peaks made up of smaller hills and rocks).

In daily life, recursion shows up in folder systems on computers (folders inside more folders), Russian nesting dolls (a doll inside another doll), and family trees (each person connects to parents, grandparents, and so on).

** Explain how your code mirrors a natural process?
The code acts like a real tree going through the seasons. In fall, the fallLeaves() method makes each branch lose its leaves, just like trees do when the weather changes. In spring, the growLeaves() method makes them grow back. The windStrength variable adds a bit of randomness, like real wind causing some branches to lose more leaves than others.

** What did you learn about recursion from simulating something organic?
I learned that recursion can make complex things from simple rules. By defining what one branch does, the same action repeats through all the smaller branches automatically.
